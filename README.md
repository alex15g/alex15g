# Alexandru Gavriș

Computer Engineering student at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (UTCN), with hands-on experience in embedded systems and software development through academic and practical projects.

I am particularly interested in low-level programming, digital system design, and backend development. I enjoy building structured systems, understanding how they work at a deeper level, and writing clean, efficient code.
